## Description

Sometimes it becomes quite tedius to write long strings of commands or open some GUI and do something there repeatedly. So, these tasks can be automated with simple python or bash scripts. This repository contains some of my own scripts which i use frequently to save myself some trouble.

Feel free to hack them, modufy them and suggest new features and enhancements. Enjoy!
