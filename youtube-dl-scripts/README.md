## Description

I download a lot of videos from youtube, at the best quality audio/video possible, and it was becomming quite tedius to write long strings of commands of youtube-dl everytime. So, i just put everything i wanted, the way i wanted in a bash script and saved me some trouble.

Feel free to hack them, modify them or suggest enhancements. Enjoy!


## Requirements

youtube-dl can be found at https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl


## Usage:

Its pretty simple

`<script_name> <video_or_playlist_url> <path_to_download_location>`
